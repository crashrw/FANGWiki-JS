#Entity Properties
___

An Entity is a collection of defined parameters / properties that instruct 
the FANG Engine on how to construct a bot, prop, weapon or etc.
If you want the Mil Grunt to spawn with a specific weapon or you want to
instruct a bot to patrol a certain region, this is how you change that.

This page is meant to serve as a collection of all the different
available properties and how they affect the entity they are
attached to.
