#CSV Overview
___

The FANG Engine makes extensive use of CSV files to define multiple different
properties rather than the alternative of hard coding them into the executable.

The most common use of the csv is for additional parameters not defined in the wld
files like skyboxes, sound banks, etc.

Due to the large variety of csv files within the game, the variants has been given
their own category within the sidebar.
