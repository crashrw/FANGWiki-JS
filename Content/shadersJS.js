#Shaders
___

The FANG Engine makes extensive use of pre configured shaders. Whether it's
liquid, metal, shiny, etc, every surface is linked to a shader.

A special property of shaders is the ability to specify an ID that can
be used to inject special functionality into a shader. For example, the
logic that controls the intensity of Glitch's battle damage is controlled
by an ID.

<Note> This is where we should include a table with all the different IDs
and their functionality. </Note>
