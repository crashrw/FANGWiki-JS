##Editions
___

##Xbox

*The* definitive Metal Arms experience. This was the primary version Swingin
Ape developed for. It is objectively the most uncompromised version spotting
the highest texture resolution, fog, proper water shader admist other graphical
effects.

##GameCube

The gamecube port is a very solid port of the Xbox version retaining 90% of
the game's graphical effects.

##PS2

The PS2 port objectively suffered the most being ported from Xbox. This version
halves the framerate to 30 FPS, (Frames Per Second) changes almost every shader
and features radically different sound effects compared to the others. It does
however load the fastest.
