#Mst File Format
___

The **M**a**st**er (Mst) file is the archive file that stores the majority of files within the game.
The file can be compared to a .zip or .7z file with no compression.

Mst files have the ability to be optimized to reduce load times.
When an mst has been optimized it has become "locked".
The process in which mst files can be optimized however is currently 
unknown and requires more research.
