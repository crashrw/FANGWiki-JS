# Csv File Format
___

**C**omma **S**eperated **V**alues (CSV) are text files that are similar to excel spreadsheets
or google sheets. Don't be fooled by the csv extension however, the compiled .csv
files found in Metal Arms have been converted to a custom binary format. 

Due to the vast # of CSV files found within Metal Arms, they have been given their own category on
the sidebar, the overview can be found [here](index.html#csvOverview).
