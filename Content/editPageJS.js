# How to edit an existing page
___

Each page of the wiki is contained with a .js (javascript) file. These .js files
are essentially Markdown files, meaning that you can write markdown into these
files and when you open up the page on the wiki it will be formatted as such.

To find the page you want to edit, first click on that page within the wiki.
You will see that the URL has changed and there is now a # followed by a word.
The word after the # is the name of the javascript file minus JS.js. That file lives
in the Content folder. You can open that file in any text editor and begin editing,
After you make changes you can save the file, refresh the wiki and see your changes.

<note> If after you make changes the page is completely white,
the formatting has broken, CTRL + Z your changes until
text appears again. </note>
